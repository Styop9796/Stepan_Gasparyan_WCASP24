In our database model we have Sales and Payments tables and each of them can be considered as a fact table , in my opinion we need to combine them into one main fact table as we also need to have AMOUNT measure in our fact table. Others are dimenisons , so wee need to store all relations denormalized by joining all realtions.I'm not sure about to have all address attributes in each of dimenisons, I think star schama not the best solution for this model.
