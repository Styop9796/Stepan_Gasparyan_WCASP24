We can't load our datasets directly into 3NF layer beacuse our data needs to be properly investigated and cleasned. Also we need to figure out data model and how things will be recorded in our data warehouse. We will create DWH strucure to not have any redundant data and all information will be tracked and if anything will be changed ,  we will have  dimentions that are going to be Slowly changing dimentions , and we will track that behavior as well.We are going to fill our warehouse from different sources and if we try to load directly into 3NF layer we will have inconsistencies. So before loading data into 3NF layer we need to make sure that our data model is clear to us and all no needed attributes are cleaned.
